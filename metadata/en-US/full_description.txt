# Global Icon Pack
An Xposed module for applying icon packs globally

Some launchers support icon packs, however the icons are usually inconsistent across the whole system. For example, the Settings page and the Recent Apps screen may retain the default icons.
This module is designed to extend the customization of icon packs throughout the entire system.

## Requirements
* AOSP based OS (I tested on android 14, 15)
* Magisk
* LSPosed

## Installation
1. Install the apk.
2. Select the recommend apps in lsposed (Other launcher/apps may also work, depending on the api they use)
3. Open Global Icon Pack, choose an icon pack.
4. Open the three dot menu, click each of `Restart *`.

* Recent screen will use your default launcher unless you use quickswitch. So you will need to select pixel launcher for that to work.
* Pixel launcher saves its icon database in `/data/data/com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher/databases/app_icons.db`.

## Known Issues
* If the launcher is slow to boot or crashes, switch to 'local' mode.
